# Robot

Robot is a bot for Twitch.TV IRC that learns from people and responds to them with things that it has learned.

For project management reasons, this repository now represents a complete rewrite of Robot.
The version RobotIsBroken is running is [v0.1.0](https://github.com/zephyrtronium/robot/tree/v0.1.0).
Links that RobotIsBroken posts in chat refer to that version.
